                You are on a game show. Behind one of these doors is
                a new car. Behind two others are piles of coal. 
                When the host asks you to pick one of the
                doors, you choose the left door at random.
                Then, the host opens the right door with coal 
                behind it, and asks if you want to switch 
                your choice. If you want a new car, would it be 
                advantageous to switch?

                One might think not, considering you are choosing
                between two doors. Surely, this situation means
                there is a 50% chance of getting a car regardless
                of what door you finally choose. However, the real
                answer is much more unintuitive. It turns out that
                there is an advantage to switching from your initial
                choice to the new door! Let's explore the reason as
                to why. When you chose a door at random in the
                beginning, you had a one-third or approximately
                33.3% chance of getting the car. That probability
                does not change when a new door is revealed! It
                remains 33.3% and does not increase to 50%.
                The key to understanding this puzzle is that
                nothing changes behind the door you chose just because
                another door has opened. Now that the right door is
                open, the question essentially becomes, "Was it more likely
                the car was behind the door I chose, or any of the other doors?"
                Clearly the latter is more likely, and therefore the chance
                of getting a new car by switching is 66.6%!
            </p>
